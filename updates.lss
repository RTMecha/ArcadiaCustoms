2.0.0 > [Mar 12, 2024]
- Created a new Online Server that you can upload modded levels to and download modded levels from, although it is not fully implemented yet. It will be ready in 2.1.0 or so.
- Fixed a bug with the [NEXT] button not showing up if there's no [GET SONG] button.
- Completely reworked the Arcade UI to better fit what it used to be and allow for keyboard, controller and mouse support. However, if you want to use the original modded UI, you can. The new UI includes the following:
- Local tab: Play levels from your local beatmaps/arcade folder (or from a custom one).
- Online tab: Download levels that people have uploaded to the custom server and place it into your local levels folder.
- Browser tab: Select a level from anywhere on your computer and play it.
- Download tab: Download a singular level from a URL and add it to your local levels.
- Queue tab: Manage your current Arcade Queue.
- Steam tab: Play already subscribed levels or subscribe to levels on the workshop.
1.6.3 > [Feb 5, 2024]
- Forgot to make ArcadiaCustoms register to RTFunctions mod compatibility.
1.6.2 > [Dec 26, 2023]
- Time in level should now calculate correctly rather than being in the negatives.
- Remove level loading log to make it load faster.
- Added message box notification for if the arcade directory doesn't exist or there are no levels to load.
1.6.1 > [Dec 19, 2023]
- Fix for reload button not actually reloading the list.
1.6.0 > [Dec 18, 2023]
- Implemented new level loading system, making loading levels faster than they were before and also allowing for custom end points.
- Cleaned up some unused code and removed some configs.
- Removed Showcase level.
- Removed startup code for security concerns.
1.5.0 > [Oct 21, 2023]
- Fixed some more UI scale issues.
- Added an online level showcase! This gets automatically updated every time you reload your level list if you have the option on. This level will get updated every now and then.
1.4.8 > [Sep 19, 2023]
- When the level starts, a .cs file will run if it exists in the level folder. This can be good for modifying the level in specific ways.
1.4.7 > [Aug 28, 2023]
- RTFunctions 1.3.0 support.
1.4.6 > [Aug 2, 2023]
- In case the players don't clear when exiting to the main menu, the players should clear when you enter the Input Select scene.
1.4.5 > [July 31, 2023]
- Brought back the 4 extra players for a total of 8 players! And this time it actually works (it never actually worked in previous versions from what I know)
- Loading into the arcade list from a level should now skip the loading sequence.
1.4.4 > [July 20, 2023]
- Fixed a bug with encrypted song loading bug so now the arcade can play them.
1.4.3 > [July 10, 2023]
- Added arcade loading screen just before the arcade list.
- Added extra game speeds.
1.4.2 > [July 3, 2023]
- Fixed an EditorManagement level loading conflict.
- Apparently I completely forgot to add the new events after ColorSplit, so they should now properly load.
1.4.1 > [May 30, 2023]
- Editor no longer needs to be loaded first before entering the arcade scene in order to obtain specific assets. Everything is generated on its own now.
- Most text elements have been changed to use TextMeshProUGUI instead of the usual UnityEngine.UI.Text component. This allows for some neat colors!
- Changed some code relating to loading the music first in the level. Still having some problems with it though.
1.4.0 > [May 29, 2023]
- Added a configurable fix for the issue where loading a level might sometimes either make the timeline all short or make it really long and break objects past a certain point.
- Replaced the usual Legacy Arcade UI with a new UI that's similar to the editor UI.
- The mod is now on Github!
1.3.6 > [Apr 7, 2023]
- The arcade can now load encrypted song files known as "song.lsen" files. If this file exists in the level folder, it will load the song from there. The song cannot be loaded from the editor and only from the arcade.
- Changed some internal code stuff.
1.3.5 > [Mar 15, 2023]
- Did some internal changes that allow other mods to load stuff from levels in the arcade.
1.3.4 > [Mar 5, 2023]
- Made arcade load a ton faster when entering the "Specify Simulations" screen, so the game won't freeze when loading everything.
1.3.3 > [Feb 16, 2023]
- HOPEFULLY THIS TIME fixed the level loading issue, now the mod SHOULD check if a file is a correct metadata or if it exists.
1.3.2 > [Feb 8, 2023]
- This mod allows you to load levels from beatmaps/story.
- Added customization to the grid elements of the arcade (only grid h, grid v and page size do something, Idk if grid width does anything)
- Fixed an issue with a previous build that didn't properly load the arcade. (Apparently not)
1.3.1 > [Feb 6, 2023]
-Added a bool option via the config setting that allows you to turn off / on the arcade reloading function the mod does. (Best to use ConfigurationManager for this)
1.3.0 > [Feb 6, 2023]
- Finally made it so you can load arcade levels directly from the beatmaps/story folder. Should be much more convenient to test / record Legacy levels now. (Plus, this should load a load quicker since instead of having to go through a whole boot menu, you just have to select the [ARCADE] button, go into the Specify Simulations menu and it'll automatically load every level from beatmaps/story!)
- The original method of loading levels is still there, but I might remove it in the next few updates or something.
1.2.1 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Ripped the Custom themes feature from this mod and put it into a different mod that allows you to customize your menus.
1.2.0 > [Feb 2, 2023]
-Began laying the groundwork for a new arcade list system, similar to the level list popup in the editor.
- Also started working on custom menu music, but still unsure about that one.
- Added a bool option to prevent you from accidentally loading into a level if you don't want to.
- Custom menu themes have been added! Check the Project Arrhythmia/settings/menu.lss file for the menu themes. You can create your own by copying and pasting the theme chunk and making your own.
1.1.0 > [Jan 11, 2023]
- The mod now loads levels directly from the beatmaps/story directory. It can load levels from sub-directories too, for example: "beatmaps/story/series name/chapter name/level name".
- Adds an option to turn anti-aliasing on.
- Press F2 to load into the game scene and load a level. Still trying to figure out a good way of getting this to work.
- This mod is integrated with Object Tags 1.3.0 so you can load through custom stories. 
1.0.0 > [Dec 10, 2022]
- This mod aims to improve the way the arcade works. Currently, it allows you to set the folder location of a single level. You can change the folder location of the first level in the Arcade List to any directory you want, like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Project Arrhythmia\beatmaps\editor\Dummy Level". So yeah, you can now play any level you want from any directory using the Config manager.
